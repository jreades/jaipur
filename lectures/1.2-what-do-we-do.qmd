This is from an article (see references at the end) by a **practicing data scientist** on the importance of communication skills. Their argument, with which I'd broadly agree, is that:

1. Writing is used everywhere the corporate world.
2. Writing brings clarity to your thinking process.
3. Writing is the 'last mile'.

I think there's a lot you can take away from that article, so I'd strongly encourage you to read it for yourself. Notice the **focus on the 'so what'** question and the emphasis on **story telling**. If you can you do this now, you'll find the dissertation that much easier.

Keep it short. Keep it simple. Keep it direct. Signpost. Don't try to use complicated vocabulary where plain-English will do. This is something that ChatGPT gets wrong a *lot* when you ask it to do 'academic writing'.

Use figures where they replace a paragraph (or more) of content. Use a sentence where it can replace a figure (or more) of content.

Ask students what they think a data scientists does.

Good answers can be added below.

## The 'Pipeline' {auto-animate=true}

- Code
- Analyse
- Understand
- Communicate
- Report

Here are five things that we might imagine any data scientists, spatial or otherwise, does. 

Do we think they're in the right order?

I can tell you right now that this sequence of steps is how to get a mark of between 45 and 63 in your dissertation.

## The 'Pipeline' {auto-animate=true}

- Understand
- Code
- Report
- Analyse
- Communicate

::: {.notes}

Here's a slightly better order, here's why:

- You can't answer a question -- from your boss, from an academic, from your friends even -- if you don't understand it. So before you run off and start writing some code, the first thing you need to do is understand the problem you're trying to solve. That problem should *not* be technical, it should be *practical*. 
- Once you understand the problem you can start trying to code a solution.
- The code will allow you to produce reports. These reports might be to do with data quality, they might be diagnostics from a Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm. At each stage in the development of your results you should be generating reports that help you to better-understand your problem and work out if your code is working.
- Once the reports have given you confidence in your findings now you can actually *write* the analysis. Your analysis might lead you to realise that you need to go back and write more code and produce more reports, but that's *normal*.
- Finally, you need to work out how to *communicate* your analysis. If you *understand* the problem then you'll find this process rewarding. If you don't then you'll find it frustrating and want to brush it off quickly.

So the fact these are in a list is still rather misleading because at each point you get feedback effects, and it's *also* a loop.

# On Writing & Coding

## Writing & Coding == Thinking

<blockquote style="margin-top:250px;margin-left:50px;">If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn’t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial. ~ @graham:2022 </blockquote>

## Clarity == Understanding

<blockquote style="margin-top:250px;margin-left:50px;">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard. ~ @mccullough:2002 </blockquote>

## Tell Me a Story

<blockquote style="margin-top:250px;margin-left:50px;">All data science is, ultimately, a story.</blockquote>

::: {.notes}

A story of struggle. Frustration. Discovery. Learning. But you need to *tell* that story the right way.

Many of you will have learned some 'system' for writing in school. The inverted pyramid or something like that. In university, in my literary *theory* class I picked up the pyramid approach: taking a single sentence and unpacking that into the themes of the entire book.

There are mystery novels. Romance novels. Economist articles. Teen Vogue articles. They are all telling stories. They all do this in different ways.
