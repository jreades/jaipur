## How to *Read*

Although the guidance below, from [Tim Squirrel's Guide](https://www.timsquirrell.com/blog/how-to-write-undergraduate-essays) for undergraduate essays, is about reading so that you can write an essay in history or philosophy, the advice works for *all* kinds of reading.

So, make sure that you cite the people who originally came up with the ideas you're presenting, and ideally think about how you would *differ from* or *improve upon* or *disagree with* them. The only way you can do this (and consequently, the only way to get a decent mark) is to do some reading.

1. **Look at the reading list**. If it’s incredibly long, you probably won’t want to (or be able) to read it all. However, that is *not* an excuse to not read any of it. Look through the list, identify if there are any readings marked as essential. Read them. If there aren’t any essential readings, pick a few which look interesting and relevant, then read them.
2. Read some more. If the reading list is really short, you’ll need to go beyond it. If it’s long, this is still relevant. Look through the reference lists of the papers and books you’ve just read. See where their ideas came from. Mark out a few of the most promising-looking readings. Read them.
3. There is a difference between **reading to understand** the topic, and **reading to reference**. It is *totally fine* to use Wikipedia, lecture notes, etc to familiarise yourself with the key arguments and concepts. It is considerably less fine to cite them.
4. Books. **Do *not* read whole books**. It’s a waste of your time. You won’t remember any of it, it will drain all of your energy, and you only get one reference and viewpoint out of it. Read the intro and conclusion so that you get the gist of their argument. Pick a chapter from the contents page which looks like it’s relevant to your essay. Read that. As above, find relevant references and follow them up.
5. Articles. **Read the abstract first**. Does it look like it’s relevant? If not, don’t waste your time. If it does, read it. Check the bibliography as above.
6. Read critically. **For the sake of all that is holy, read critically**. This is absolutely essential. Don’t just stare at the pages and absorb them, bovine-like, for the purposes of regurgitation into your essay. **Think** about:
   1. The central claim the author is making. Usually there is only one, perhaps two. Summarise it in one sentence if you can.
   2. What is the frame of their argument? When in history is it set? Who are the key actors? Are they responding to another author? If so, what is the argument they’re responding to? Try to position their argument in context. This allows you to:
   3. Critically assess the claims made. This obviously doesn’t just mean ‘say they’re wrong’. They might well be wrong, but you’ll need to find reasons for it. Generate a list of three reasons for each line of attack you want to take. Scrap the weakest two. If you think they’re right, *why* are they right? Are there other authors who corroborate their claims? Are there logical reasons to prefer their argument?

Make sure you take notes on everything you read. Put page numbers in those notes. In fact, write down a few potentially useful (and ideally flexible) quotes verbatim.
