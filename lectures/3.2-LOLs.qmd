# What the heck is *this*?
```python
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```
How about if we rewrote it like *this*?
```python
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

::: {.notes}
What does this *look* like?
:::

## Making Sense of This

We can 'unpack' `my_list` in stages in order to make sense of it:

```python
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]

for i in my_list:
  print(i)
```

What do you **think** this will print?

## Debugging Our Thinking

Let's make it a little more obvious:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [7, 8, 9]

my_list = [a, b, c]

for i in my_list:
  print(i) # Prints a, b, c in turn...
```

## The Next Step
We could then try this:
```python
for i in my_list:
  print(f" >> {i}")
  for j in i: # Remember that i is a list!
    print(j)
```
This produces:
```python
 >> [1, 2, 3]
1
2
3
 >> [4, 5, 6]
4
...
```

## Putting It Together {.smaller}

Some observations:

- We can access `i` in `my_list` using *either* `for i in my_list` (every element in turn) or `my_list[i]` (one element only). 
- We can access `j` in list `i` using `for j in i` (every element in turn) or `i[j]` (one element only). 

Does that mean we can *also* do this:
```python
my_list = [
  [1, 2, 3], 
  [4, 5, 6], 
  [7, 8, 9]
]

i,j = 0,1
print(my_list[i][j])
```

## Let's Talk It Out!

So if we write:
```python
i,j = 0,1
print(my_list[i][j])
```

Then:

1. `my_list[i]` returns `[1,2,3]` (because `i==0` and the first list is `[1,2,3]`), and
2. `my_list[i][j]` returns `2` (because `j==1` and the `[1,2,3][1]==2`).

Similarly, `my_list[2]` grabs the third list (`[7,8,9]`) and then `my_list[2][2]` tells Python to get the third item in that third list (i.e. `9`).

How you print the number 5 from this *list-of-lists*?

## Making This Useful

If I rewrite the list *this way* perhaps it looks a little more useful?
```python
my_cities = [
  ['London', 51.5072, 0.1275, +0], 
  ['New York', 40.7127, 74.0059, -5], 
  ['Tokyo', 35.6833, 139.6833, +8]
]
```
Now we have something that is starting to look like *data*!

# Things are about to get... weird.

## Down the Rabbit Hole
![](img/Alice.png)

## LOLs of LOLs

This is *also* a legitimate list in Python. 
```python
my_cities = [
  ['London', [51.5072, 0.1275], +0], 
  ['New York', [40.7127, 74.0059], -5], 
  ['Tokyo', [35.6833, 139.6833], +8]
]
print(my_cities[0][0])
> London
print(my_cities[0][1][0])
> 51.5072
```

::: {.notes}
Why might it be a *better* choice of *data structure* than the earlier version?
:::

# How Deep Can You Go?

> There is no real limit to how many lists you can nest inside of other lists, but it's *hard* to make sense of: `my_cities[0][1][4][1][8]`!

::: {.notes}

That's why most sane people rarely use more then three levels of lists. You will see developers iterate over them using `i`, `j`, and `k`.
