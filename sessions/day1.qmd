A basic understanding of core concepts in reproducible analysis and the advantages of moving to open data and open source code.
:::

- Poll: how many people have used GIS? If so, which one?
- Poll: how many people have learned a programming language? If so, which one?

Introductory session:

- [1.1 Getting Started](../lectures/1.1-the_week.qmd)
- [1.2 What Do (Spatial) Data Scientists Do](../lectures/1.2-what-do-we-do.qmd)
- [1.3 Our Principles](../lectures/1.3-principles.qmd)
- [1.4 Our Tools](../lectures/1.4-tools.qmd)
 
Applied session:

We are trying to do three things:

1. Install required utilities: [WSL for Windows or Xcode for Mac](../setup/base.qmd)
- [Setting up Podman](../setup/installation.qmd)
- [Running Podman](../setup/installation.qmd#running)
