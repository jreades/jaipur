    "\n",
    "If you stop to think about it, then our list-of-lists approach to the\n",

    "such as the `sum` of a field for all rows we need to step through a lot\n",
    "of irrelevant data as well: we have to write a `for` loop and then step\n",
    "through each row with an ‘accumulator’ (somewhere to store the total).\n",
    "That’s slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn’t make much sense since this should all be *easier* and\n",
    "*faster* in Python than in Excel, but right now it’s *harder*, and quite\n",
    "possibly *slower* as well! So how does the experienced programmer get\n",
    "around this? ‘Simple’ (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know\n",
    "the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We\n",
    "humans tend to think in rows of data: this apartment has the following\n",
    "*attributes* (price, location, etc.), or that city has the following\n",
    "*attributes* (population, location). We read across the row because\n",
    "that’s the easiest way for *us* to think about it. But, in short, a\n",
    "list-of-lists does *not* seem to be the right way to store this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a computer doesn’t have to work that way. For a computer,\n",
    "it’s as easy to read *down* a column as it is to read *across* a row.\n",
    "**In fact, it’s easier**, because each column has the same *type* of\n",
    "data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains\n",
    "prices (integers), and other columns contain other types of data\n",
    "(floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often doesn’t\n",
    "matter as long as we know what the columns are called: it’s easier to\n",
    "ask for the ‘description column’ than it is to ask for the 6th column\n",
    "since, for all we know, the description column might be in a different\n",
