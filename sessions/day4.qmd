### Goal

To get you using the tools taught to create maps and plots using data.

Introductory session:

- An introduction to Quarto (some examples of what you can do):
  - [The Palmer Penguins](https://apreshill.github.io/palmerpenguins-useR-2022/#/title-slide)
  - [Create beautiful documents with R, Python, Julia and Observable](https://runapp2022.talks.jamesgoldie.dev/#/james-goldie)
  - [Other 'Real-Life Examples' of Presentations, Web Sites and Books](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto#real-life-examples)

Applied session:

- You have three ways that you can work on the project:
  1. Creating a PDF report in Quarto starting from: [Report.qmd](../practicals/Report.qmd) and [include-in-header.tex](../practicals/include-in-header.tex). *[These need to be in the same directory!]*
  2. Creating a Presentation (which you view in your browser) from: [Presentation.qmd](../practicals/Presentation.qmd).
  3. Creating a Web Page (which you obviously view in your browser) from: [Web_Page.qmd](../practicals/Web_Page.qmd).
- Adding new data to your map
- Changing colours, line widths, ..., choropleths and maps-in-maps.
- Working on a report â€” choosing a topic of interest (continuation of Day 3)
