Over the years, we have experimented with a range of approaches to setting you up with a programming environment, and we have come to the conclusion that **Podman**^[And Docker, which is basically the same thing.] is the most robust way to ensure a consistent experience. This guarantees that all students end up with the same versions of each library, that difficult-to-diagnose hardware/OS issues are minimised, and that running/recovery is the most straightforward.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you encounter any problems with the installation, please have a look at the [Dealing with Docker Problems](./problems.qmd) page.
