### How They Work

*One* way to think of Podman/Docker is as a 'library' of ready-made *virtual* computers that you can copy and use free-of-charge. If you'd like to know more about what Podman/Docker are and how they work, you can read more in the [Understanding Virtualisation](virtualisation.qmd) section.

### Windows Users

Please ensure that you have installed WSL2 *before* installing Docker! If you cannot install WSL2 then please have a look at the 'dealing with errors' section.

*After* you've downloaded Podman (first choice) or Docker (second choice), you need to:

1. Install it -- usually this will mean opening the image and either dragging it your Application folder (Mac) or running the installer (Windows)
2. Start it up -- double-click the Podman/Docker icon in your Applications folder to start the application running.
3. Finish setup -- you *may* see a login screen like the one below, but you do *not* need to create an account (notice `Continue without signing in`)
4. On all the subsequent questions you can `Skip` (upper-right corner) answering as well.

You **must finish setting up** before proceeding to the next step. You'll know that you're ready to move on when you see either the 'Podman Desktop' or 'Docker Desktop' window appear listing 'downloaded images' and 'running containers':

If you *didn't* see this then you will need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](#dealing-with-errors)' section.
