## Testing

To test if the application (Docker or Podman) is installed correctly, you will need either the `Terminal` (macOS) or the `Windows Terminal` (Windows).

## Copy Code to Clipboard 

Whenever you see a 'code block' below, you will _also_ see a 'clipboard' icon (![Copy to Clipboard Icon](../img/copy-to-clipboard.png){height="18px"}) in the right. Click that, and the code will be copied to your computer's 'clipboard' so that you can then paste it into the `Terminal` or `Windows Terminal` (see [Base Utilities](./base.qmd#base-utilities). That will save you a lot of time and effort.

Both Podman and Docker have provided a simple way to test if your installation is working correctly. You can run the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Podman 
```bash
podman run hello-world
```
This should output something like:

This should output something like:

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

:::

If you see these messages, then Podman/Docker are installed correctly and you can move on to the next step. If you see an error message, then you will need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](#dealing-with-errors)' section. Notice how there are several things happening:

1. `Trying to pull...` or `Pulling from library/hello-world` -- this is starting the process of downloading the `hello-world` image from the internet.
2. `Pull complete` or `Writing manifest to image destination` -- this is telling you that it has finished downloading the image.
3. `Hello from Docker!` or `Hello Podman World` -- this is the `hello-world` image running and telling you that the image now running as a container.

There's obviously a *lot* more to that message, but that's the basic idea.
