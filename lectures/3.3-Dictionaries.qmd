# A Python dictionary is like a real dictionary: you find things (values) using a word (key) instead of having to read the whole book.

::: {.notes}

What advantages might this have over a list? 

:::

## So: Key -> Value

The key can be *almost* anything that is *immutable* (aka. hashable). So these are all 'legit':

```python
lookup[1]             # Int
lookup(52.1)          # Float
lookup['1']           # String
lookup['Jon Reades']  # String
k = 'Jon Reades'
lookup[k]             # String variable
lookup[(52.1, -0.04)] # Tuple
```
But this is not:
```python
lookup[['Jon','Reades']] # Error, unhashable type
```

That's because a list is *not* immutable.


::: {.notes}

Again, just like a real dictionary: you don't have multiple entries for 'dog', otherwise the dictionary wouldn't *work*. You might have multiple definitions: which is to say, the key might return multiple values.

:::

---

## Deliberately Similar

Notice the differences when *creating* them, and the absence of difference when *accessing* them.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="43%"}

### List
```python
cities = [
  'San Francisco',
  'London',
  'Paris',
  'Beijing']
  
# Prints London
print(cities[2]) 
```

:::
::: {.column width="57%"}
### Dict
```python
cities = {
  'San Francisco': 837442,
  'London': 8673713,
  'Paris': 837442,
  'Beijing': '0.17'00000}

# Prints pop of London
print(cities['London'])
```
:::
::::

::: {.notes}

So why might we prefer the dictionary?

1. Dicts are **created** using: `d = { key: value, key: value }`
2. Dicts are **accessed** using: `d[key]`

So the only difference between lists and dicts is: `[...]` and `{...}` when they are created.

Over the next couple of weeks we'll see ways that you can store more information in a list and also why lists are *sometimes* more powerful than you realise... *if* you can think about your data in an entirely new way. But for simple key/value stuff it's hard to beat a dictionary!

:::

## It's All About Access

Specifically: do we need sequential or random access?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### List

| index | value |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | San Francisco |
| 1 | London |
| 2 | Paris |
| 3 | Beijing|

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Dict

| key | value |
| :---- | -----: |
| San Francisco | 837442 |
| London | 8673713 |
| Paris | 2229621 |
| Beijing | 21700000 |

## Getting Values

There are two ways to retrieve values from a dictionary:

1. `cities['Beijing']`
2. `cities.get('Beijing')`

Why have two? Consider:
```python
cities = {
  'San Francisco': 837442,
  'London': 8673713,
  'Paris': 837442,
  'Beijing': '0.17'00000}

print(cities['Sao Paulo'])     # Throws KeyError
print(cities.get('Sao Paulo')) # Returns None
print(cities.get('Sao Paulo','No Data')) # Returns 'No Data'
```

::: {.notes}

The first triggers an **error**, the second returns `None`. Errors _can_ be unfriendly: do you want your entire Python program to fail because a single city is missing, or would you rather than it did something a little more sensible such as... skipping the row or returning a sensible default?

:::

## Getting Values (cont'd)

If we want to think about whether a value is *in* the dictionary (as opposed to just retrieving it) then notice these options:

```python
c = cities.get('Sao Paulo')
if not c:
  print("Sorry, no city by that name.")

if 'Beijing' in cities:
  print("Found Beijing!")
```

::: {.notes}
The first example works because `cities.get` returns `None`, which is the same as 'undefined' for Python. So we can use 'not' to imply 'if c is not defined then do something...'

The second example works because we are implicitly treating the *keys* in the cities dictionary as a list and looking to see if Beijing is one of the values in that list. 

Python often benefits *and* suffers from TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It): think of these as being different ways to say the same thing, but depending on where you want to put the emphasis you would choose one or the other.
:::

## Setting Values {.smaller}

It's the same process to update an existing value or create a new one:
```python
cities = {}  # Empty dictionary
cities['Beijing'] = 21716620    # Sets key->value
cities['Toronto'] = 2930000     # Sets key->value

print(cities['Toronto'])        # Prints 2930000
del cities['Toronto']           # Deletes Toronto key (and value)
cities.pop('Toronto','Default') # Prints 'Default' b/c key not found
print(cities)
```
This last command outputs:
```python
{'Beijing': '0.17'16620}
```


## Iterating {.smaller}

Similar to iterating over lists but... 

```python
cities = {
  'San Francisco': 837442,
  'London': 8673713,
  'Paris': 837442,
  'Beijing': '0.17'00000}

for c in cities:
  print(c)
```
Prints:
```python
'San Francisco'
'London'
'Paris'
'Beijing'
```

::: {.notes}

One *really* important point to note: here, the cities are printed out in the *same* order that they were added to the dictionary, but that is *not* guaranteed! Unlike lists, dictionaries are **unordered**.

Also, how would we print out the population of each city?

## {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}

### Keys
```python
for k in cities.keys():
  print(k)
```

Prints:
```python
'San Francisco'
'London'
'Paris'
'Beijing'
```

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Values
```python
for v in cities.values():
  print(v)
```

Prints:
```python
837442
8673713
2229621
21716620
```

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
### Both
```python
for k,v in cities.items():
  print(f"{k} -> {v}")
```

Prints:
```python
San Francisco -> 837442
London -> 8673713
Paris -> 837442
Beijing -> 21700000
```

:::
::::

## A Final Note! {.smaller}

Values can be almost anything, including a dictionary or list! This opens up some interesting possibilities:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="42%"}
```python
cities = {
  'San Francisco': 
    [37.77, -122.43, 'SFO']
}
```
:::
::: {.column width="58%"}

```python
cities = {
  'San Francisco': {
    'lat': 37.77,
    'lon': -122.43,
    'airport':'SFO'}
}
print(cities['San Francisco']['lat'])
```
:::
::::

*Spoiler*: you're going to encounter this kind of thing a *lot*.

::: {.notes}

What is this starting to look like? This is *basically* what JSON is.

:::

# One More Thing...

You may come across this:
```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
```
It _looks_ like a dictionary, but where are the keys? 
```python
type(s)
> <class 'set'>
```
A set is just a group of unique keys (no values attached). They have many uses!


::: {.notes}

It looks like a cross between a list and a dictionary because, conceptually for our purposes, that's not far from the truth.

Sets can be used, for instance, to generate categories from a column in a data set: we don't worry about what order the categories come in, we only care about them as _unique entries_ in the column!

:::

## Danger, Will Robinson!

> Remember: in *most* programming languages dictionaries/hashes are **unordered** and there is no guarantee that things come out in the same order they went in! They **complement** ordered lists, they don't **replace** them!
