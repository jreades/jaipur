## Installing

### How They Work

*One* way to think of Podman is as a 'library' of ready-made *virtual* computers that you can copy and use free-of-charge. If you'd like to know more about what Podman are and how they work, you can read more in the [Understanding Virtualisation](virtualisation.qmd) section.

### Windows Users

Please ensure that you have installed WSL2 *before* installing or Podman! If you cannot install WSL2 then please have a look at the 'dealing with errors' section.

:::

*After* you've downloaded Podman:

1. Install it -- usually this will mean opening the image and either dragging it your Application folder (Mac) or running the installer (Windows)
2. Start it up -- double-click the Podman icon in your Applications folder to start the application running.

If you *didn't* see this (or see lots of errors) then you will need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](#dealing-with-errors)' section.

Installation on a Mac should be fairly straightforward (as evidenced by the dearth of documentation), but for Windows there is [quite a bit more detail](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md).
